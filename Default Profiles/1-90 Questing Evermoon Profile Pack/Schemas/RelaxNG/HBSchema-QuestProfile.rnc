# =====
# This schema is more restrictive than Honorbuddy allows.
# For instance, the schema only allows the preferred name of attributes, and flags
# the alias names as errors.  For instance, the schema prefers "Id" to "Entry",
# "DestName" to "Name" (depending on context), etc.
# The intent is to:
# 1) Make the profile pack consistent throughout by using the same names
#    for the same attributes within a given context.
# 2) Maximize the readability and maintainability of the profile
#    by using descriptive names when ambiguity is possible.
#    An example of this, we prefer
#      <UseItem ... QuestId="123" ... ItemId="234" ... />
#    to
#      <UseItem ... Id="234" ... />
#    Since a quick read would be unclear whether the Id alias refers to
#    the QuestId or the ItemId.
