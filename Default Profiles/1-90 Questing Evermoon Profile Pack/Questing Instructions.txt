This is the Instructions How-To for using Questing profiles in the Honorbuddy 2 bot

1) Make sure that WoW is on and Honorbuddy is attached

If you're having issues with attaching Honorbuddy, click the Honorbuddy Guide Link
http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/guides/32615-quick-hb-guide-presentation-fast-setup.html

2) Assuming that everything works properly now - Select the 'Quest Bot' from the drop down menu of Honorbuddy

3) Click the 'Load Profile' button on Honorbuddy

4) Find the Questing Profiles in your Honorbuddy Folder
C:/.../Honorbuddy/Questing Profiles/

5) Load the appropriate profile for your Faction and level / Continent

Here is the Quest Flow for the 1-80 questing profiles:

Alliance:
1-58 EK: 1-5 Race specific, Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood, N.STV, S.STV, WPL, EPL, Badlands, Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, SoS, Blasted Lands
58-70: Hellfire, Zangarmarsh, Terrokar Forest, Nagrand, Blades Edge, Netherstorm
68-80: Borean, Howling Fjord, Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Zul'drak, Sholazar, Icecrown, Storm Peaks

Horde:
1-58: 1-5 Race specific, Durotar, N. Barrens, Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountain, S. Barrens, Desolace, Dustwallow Marsh, EPL, Felwood, Winterspring, Silithus, Blasted Lands

68-80: Borean, Howling Fjord, Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Zul'drak, Sholazar, Icecrown, Storm Peaks

Cata Profiles are started in the home city (no quests completed for that profile), or in the zone itself if you have completed some quests
Cata Profiles do have some User-Assisted quests (being automated in the near future)

6) After the correct profile is loaded, click the Plugins button on Honorbuddy and enable the following plugins and configure them for your character:
Auto Equip - This equips gear that is dropped from mobs and received from quest rewards.  Enable and Select the weapon type (1h, 2h, Dual Wield) then close the Auto Equip window
Talented - This auto-selects your talents for your character.  Select the spec you are / the spec you want to be and click save

You may want other plugins in the future for automated buying of PvP Gear, help for farming various items, mounts, etc - those are available here:
