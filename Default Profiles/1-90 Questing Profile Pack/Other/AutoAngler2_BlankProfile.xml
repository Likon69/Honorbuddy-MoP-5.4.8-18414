    <!-- AutoAngler2 "Blank Profile" for fishing in place.
         If you want to turn this into a 'real' profile you will need to provide appropriate
         values for Mailboxes, Vendors, and Hotspots.  Without these elements,
         your bags will get clogged up.
         Its mind-numbingly easy to do this, the comment sections below will guide
         you through creating each of the needed elements.

             Honorbuddy => Settings & Tools => Developer Tools will help you obtain info,
             if needed.
        -->
        <!-- Sample: <Mob Name="Vicejaw" Entry="58769" /> -->
    </AvoidMobs>


    <Blackspots>
        <!-- Explanation is out-of-scope, but
             Honorbuddy => Settings & Tools => Developer Tools will help you generate these,
             if needed.

        <!-- Sample: <Blackspot X="-1817.635" Y="285.8988" Z="5.631539" Radius="200" /> -->
    </Blackspots>


    <Mailboxes>
        <!-- <Mailbox ... />
             To include a Mailbox in the profile:
             1. In the WoWclient, move next to the desired mailbox.
             2. Open Honorbuddy's Developer Tools (Honorbuddy => Settings & Tools => Developer Tools).
             3. In the Developer Tools, select the "Objects" tab.
             4. In the "Objects" tab, select the "Game Objects" sub-tab.
             5. The Mailbox information should near the top of the list.
             6. A properly-formed Mailbox profile element looks like the following:
             ===> <Mailbox Name="Canals Mailbox 1" X="-8743.299" Y="565.2322" Z="97.53443" />
             7. You may include as many Mailbox elements as you like.  AutoAngler will always select the nearest.
        -->
    </Mailboxes>


    <Vendors>
        <!-- <Vendor .../>
             To include a repair Vendor in the profile:
             1. In the WoWclient, target the desired Vendor.
             2. Open Honorbuddy's Developer Tools (Honorbuddy => Settings & Tools => Developer Tools).
             3. In the Developer Tools, select the "Profiles" tab
             ===> The Vendor information should be available in "Current Target Info" panel.
             4. In the "Current Target Info" panel, click on the "Copy XML" button.
             ===> This emits a vendor entry to Honorbuddy's "Log" window.
             ===> In the emitted information, be certain Type="Repair" is showing.  Other types are
             ===> not used to AutoAngler.  Honorbuddy frequently identifies non-Vendor NPCs as
             ===> Type="Repair".  Be certain the NPC you have selected is in fact a Vendor.
             5. A properly-formed Vendor profile element looks like the following:
             ===> <Vendor Name="Gunther Weller" Id="1289" Type="Repair" X="-8790.421" Y="607.3484" Z="96.77347" />
             6. You may include as many Vendor elements as you like. AutoAngler will always select the nearest.
        -->
    </Vendors>


    <!-- <FishingSchool ... />
         By default, AutoAngler will fish in any fishing pool if the "Fishing Pools" setting is 'True'
         (see Honorbuddy => Settings & Tools => Bot Config).  Conversely, if "Fishing Pools" is 'False',
         AutoAngler will fish in any open water, and treat pools just like open water.
         -
         Sometimes, users are only interested in certain types of fishing pools.  To limit AutoAngler's
         search to pools only of a certain type, you can provide <FishingSchool> profile elements.
         -
         To include FishingSchool elements in the profile:
         1. In the WoWclient, move next to the desired fishing school.
         2. Open Honorbuddy's Developer Tools (Honorbuddy => Settings & Tools => Developer Tools).
         3. In the Developer Tools, select the "Objects" tab.
         4. In the "Objects" tab, select the "Game Objects" sub-tab.
         5. The fishing school information should near the top of the list.
         6. A properly-formed FishingSchool profile element looks like the following:
         ===> <FishingSchool Entry="202780" Name="Fathom Eel" />
         7. You may include as many FishingSchool elements as you like.  AutoAngler seeks any defined.
         ===> Once again, if no <FishingSchool> is defined, then AutoAngler will fish at any fishing pools.

    <!-- <Pathing Type=... />
         The Pathing element Determines how AutoAngler will treat the list of Hotpots (below).
         The acceptable values are:
         "Circle" [default]: When AutoAngler gets to the last Hotspot in the <Hotspots> list,
         the next point to be visited is the first point in the <Hotspots> list.
         "Bounce": When AutoAngler gets to the last Hotspot in the <Hotspots> list,
         AutoAngler will 'reverse the list'.  AutoAngler will then visit each hotspot (in
         reverse order) on the list, on its way back to the first Hotspot.

    -->
    <Pathing Type="Circle" />


    <Hotspots>
        <!-- <Hotspot ... />
             A Hotspot is merely a waypoint that the bot will visit while seeking fishing pools.
             AutoAngler 'sees' fishing pools within about 50 yards of the toon's current location.
             Hotspots form a path that AutoAngler follows to find fishing pools within 50 yards of
             this path.  AutoAngler notices fishing pools as it travels this path; thus, Hotspots
             do not need to be *at* the known fishing pool spawning points, they just need to cause
             AutoAngler to pass by these spawning points.
             -
             Once AutoAngler locates a fishing pool, it will select an appropriate landing site to
             address the pool.  Thus, Hotspots do not influence AutoAngler's choice of 'landing location',
             or 'casting location'.
             -
             To include Hotspots in the profiles:
             1. In the WoWclient, move the toon to the next point in the path you are defining.
             ===> The Hotspot will be in the air if you are flying, or on the ground if you can't fly.
             2. Open Honorbuddy's Developer Tools (Honorbuddy => Settings & Tools => Developer Tools).
             ===> The toon's current location should be shown in the "Local Player Info" panel.
             3. In the "Local Player Info" panel, double-click on the numbers to the right of the word "Position"
             ===> This emits the current position to Honorbuddy's "Log" window. as a Hotspot.
             4. A properly-formed Hotspot profile element looks like the following:
             ===> <Hotspot X="1229.209" Y="3663.716" Z="82.73235" />
             5. You may include as many Hotspot elements as you like.
        -->
    </Hotspots>
