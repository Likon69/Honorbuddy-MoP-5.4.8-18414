Welcome to Kick's Mega Profile Packs 1-90 (Questing, Grinding, Gathering)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
These profiles are the *official* profile pack provided by BosslandGmbH
when you purchase Honorbuddy.

This document will help you:
* Get Honorbuddy set up and working
* Get Subversion set up and working
* Obtain a copy of Kick's profiles through Subversion
* Start using Honorbuddy

The profiles are constantly being updated, so we only provide distribution
through Subversion.  Subversion is *very* easy to use, and once installed
provides access to a number of other wares offered in our forums.

Ultimately, the goal of this profile pack is to make it capable
of providing the The Loremaster achievement
(http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=7520).  We have made much progress
in this regard, but the goal is still in the distance.


Setting up Honorbuddy
---------------------
There is a wealth of information to get you off-and-away using Honorbuddy.  You can find this
information in the Guides forum (http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-guides/).

To get started using the Kick's profile pack
---------------------------------------------
The first steps to getting the profile pack involve setting up the Tortoise Subversion tool,
then extracting a copy of Kick's profile pack to your local disk.

These resources will help you get Tortoise installed and working:

* Tortoise Subversion
	This is the tool used to extract copies of any Subversion repository.
	http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
  
* Video tutorial for setting up and using Subversion (thanks, JVidia!)
	From Honorbudy forum: http://www.thebuddyforum.com/honorbuddy-forum/honorbuddy-guides/26031-guide-how-svn-jvidia.html
	Direct Youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_KJ1pn9l3Zs


Once Tortoise is working, you can extract a copy of the Proile packto your
local disk drives.  Kick's Subversion repository is located here:

* https://kicks-scripts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/


Now, use Honorbuddy's "Load Profile" button to select whichever profile
interests you.  Hit Honorbuddy's "Start" button, and you should be off-and-away.


Keeping your copy of Kick's Repository Up-to-Date
-------------------------------------------------
On a daily basis, before launching Honorbuddy, you should make certain that your copy
of Kick's repository is up-to-date.  Using Windoze file explorer:
	-> "right click" on the "Kick's Profiles" directory
	-> SVN update
	
After the process completes, copy any files you find in
	.../Kick's Profiles/1-90 Questing Profile Pack/Quest Behaviors/
into your Honorbuddy quest behavior directory:
	.../Honorbuddy/Quest Behaviors/
	
You can read more about why this is important, here:

Before you start Honorbuddy or the WoWclient, now is a good time to clear
caches.  This article provides an explanation as to the problems this eliminates,
and discusses the simple process:
